This directory contains files for speech recognition through the Google Cloud Services platform. Currently requires private key, which you can reach out to Anusha or Nick if you don't already have.
After setting google application credentials, running the speech_recogniton script should provide a continuous buffer of transcribed text.


Currently returns strings, will probably eventually return chessmove objects based on future architecture decisions.
